    "full_content": "This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.\n\nCrabbing is grueling work.\n\nFishers first prepare their crab-catching pots. Then, they boat out to sea and drop them. Inside their boats, they use devices that record the coordinates for where the pots have come to rest on the ocean floor. Then, they head back to land and wait.\n\nLater, after 12 to 24 hours, but in some cases up to a week, fishers return to the same coordinates, pull in their pots, and examine their catches.\n\nThis is where the real work begins. Every jurisdiction has rules dictating the size and weight of crabs that fishers can harvest, so crabbers must measure each crustacean's weight and shell size and then count, grade, and sort their hauls, as well as record the data they've collected, before they can consider the catch a job officially done. Until recently, most of these records have been written by hand in physical logbooks.\n\nManaging these tasks and meeting rising consumer demands for sustainable crab meat isn't easy. But a startup in Palo Alto, California, called SeafoodAI, says it has an AI-powered solution.\n\nIn April, SeafoodAI released CrabScan360, its tool designed to automate crab measurement, sorting, and data recording.\n\nRob Terry, SeafoodAI's founder and CEO, told Business Insider that CrabScan360 acts as a \"tireless deckhand\" who uses AI-powered technology to collect all necessary data, including every crab's size, weight, and grade. The software also uses this data to determine which crabs can remain part of any given haul and which ones fishers must toss back into the ocean.\n\nHow AI is helping crab fishers\n\nCrabScan360 comes in two versions: one for the field and one for the factory.\n\nThe portable field version, released in April, is about the size of a carry-on suitcase and was built to deploy quickly on boats and docks. Fishers put one crab at a time on the scanner, and the device snaps photos. It uses sensors and built-in custom software to instantly analyze and log each crab's size, weight, gender, and legal status.\n\nThe factory version, which is in development, is fully automated. Crabs move along a conveyor belt and pass under a scanner that evaluates each one. Crabs are then sorted based on the analysis. Each scan creates an individual data record that's uploaded to the cloud. Users can then log in and see trends such as average size, yield, and legal catch percentages across an entire harvest.\n\nCrabScan360 also creates a digital fingerprint for every scanned crab, providing \"instant, accurate digital records tied to the specific harvest location, time, and date,\" Terry said. This data travels with each crab as it moves through the supply chain, creating a clear chain of custody from pot to processor.\n\n\"This makes it easier to trace quality, reduce mistakes, and prevent waste,\" Terry said. \"With better data at every step, seafood companies can make faster, smarter decisions about what to keep, how to price it, and where it should go, leading to a more efficient and profitable supply chain.\"\n\nThe AI behind the digital fingerprint also helps prove that each catch is sustainable, an increasingly important credential, as leading retailers such as Whole Foods, Walmart, and Costco have committed to exclusively selling sustainably certified seafood by 2027 or earlier.\n\nWhat's next for AI-powered seafood technology\n\nTerry said that as SeafoodAI rolls out CrabScan360 to more customers, it plans to build a database to digitally connect harvesters, processors, regulators, and wholesalers with information about crab hauls in real time.\n\nThe company also plans to expand to other seafood markets, such as tuna, salmon, and shrimp, all of which have unique data collection requirements.\n\n\"Our approach lays the foundation for a more efficient, scalable, and transparent model, especially for small and medium-scale producers who are often excluded by cost or complexity,\" Terry said.\n\n\"It's a modern solution designed to meet the rising demand for trusted, traceable seafood.\""

At this time, firms do not know the ultimate level and incidence of tariffs or their duration,\" Cook said. \"Higher costs of imported materials and components could also cause firms to delay or scale back\n\ntheir investment plans.\"\n\nLess capital investment \"can lead to slower technological innovation and adoption and decreased overall efficiency,\" she said, while higher trade barriers could \"prop up less efficient firms\" and make the economy less competitive.\n\nSupply disruptions could create a further inefficiency, Cook said.\n\nArtificial intelligence could raise productivity, she said, and it remains far from clear what the net result will be over time.\n\nShe said tariffs on their own could lower potential output. Just as recent gains in productivity have helped boost growth and bring down U.S. inflation, \"a reduction in potential gross domestic product means less slack in the economy which, in tern, means greater inflationary pressure\" and potentially higher interest rates, she said.\n\n(Reporting by Howard Schneider; Editing by David Gregorio)"

    "full_content": "By Ann Saphir and Howard Schneider\n\nPalo Alto, California (Reuters) - Kevin Warsh, an apparent frontrunner to be U.S. President Donald Trump's pick to be the next chair of the Federal Reserve, on Friday suggested a possible pathway to the lower policy rates that Trump has repeatedly pressed the current Fed Chair Jerome Powell to deliver, and delivered a fresh dig at the Fed's conduct of monetary policy.\n\nA large and often growing Fed balance sheet can work at cross-purposes with the Fed's main policy lever of setting short-term borrowing rates, Warsh told a monetary policy panel at Stanford University's Hoover Institution, but \"if the printing press could be quiet, we could have lower policy rates.\"\n\nWarsh served as Fed Governor from 2006 until 2011, when he quit because he opposed the Fed's continued balance sheet expansion as central bank overreach that encouraged the expansion of the nation's debt. The Fed is currently reducing its balance sheet.\n\nOn Friday, Warsh offered an added criticism of the Fed, saying there is no \"cruel choice\" between the Fed's two objectives of stable prices and full employment, a reference to the idea long prevalent among many central bank policymakers that the cost of bringing down inflation is harm to the job market.\n\n\"What it means is, we don't have to push the unemployment rate up to get the inflation rate to fall,\" Warsh said on the sidelines of the conference. \"At the Fed, when they talk about how we get inflation down, what they really mean is, how do we get the unemployment rate up ... we need to throw people out of work to get the inflation rate to come down, which is nonsense. But that's embedded in economic thinking, including at the Fed.\"\n\nThe idea that a \"cruel choice\" is \"nonsense\" is actually largely consistent with how the Fed has conducted policy over the last several years, as it brought inflation down from 40-year highs without pushing the unemployment rate above the rate that most economists feel is consistent with full employment.\n\nPowell has repeatedly said he does not feel the current labor market is a source of inflation, suggesting that crushing the job market would do little to lower inflation.\n\nWarsh made his remarks at a conference and an institution steeped in Bush-Reagan Republicanism, now out of favor as Trump and his ideas have come to dominate the party. The conference was convened in part to celebrate John Taylor, a Bush economic adviser and author of one of the most famous monetary policy rules; Condoleezza Rice, Bush's Secretary of State, spoke on Thursday."

    "full_content": "Investing.com -- U.S. stock futures rose sharply on Sunday evening after the White House announced a trade deal with China had been reached following high-level meetings in Geneva this weekend, although no details of the agreement were released.\n\nDow futures were up 1% at 41,736.0 points, S&P 500 futures were up 1.2% at 5,745.0 points, and Nasdaq futures were up 1.5% at 30,438.75 points by 19:07 ET (23:07 GMT).\n\nGains in futures come after a positive week on Wall Street, as the prospect of a Sino-U.S. trade deal lifted spirits and spurred buying into risk-driven assets.\n\nA mostly positive first-quarter earnings season had also lifted Wall Street in recent weeks, with prints from Home Depot (NYSE:HD), Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW), Lowe’s (NYSE:LOW), Target, and Snowflake (NYSE:SNOW) due in the coming days.\n\nUS-China trade deal reached in Switzerland\n\nU.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said on Sunday afternoon that a trade deal had been struck with China, although they did not offer any more details.\n\n“We’re confident that the deal we struck with our Chinese partners will help us to work toward resolving [the trade deficit],” Greer said in a statement posted to the White House’s website.\n\n“It’s important to understand how quickly we were able to come to agreement, which reflects that perhaps the differences were not so large as maybe thought,” Greer added.\n\nBessent also flagged \"substantial progress between the U.S. and China in the very important trade talks,\" adding that he spoke to President Donald Trump and that there will be a complete briefing on Monday morning.\n\nChinese state media said that Beijing and Washington will issue a joint statement over the trade talks on Monday. Li Chenggang, China’s vice minister of Commerce, was quoted saying that \"no matter when this statement is released, it’s going to be big news and good news for the world.\"\n\nThe U.S. currently has a 145% tariff on Chinese imports, and recent reports suggested that this could be reduced to around 50%, although President Trump said on Friday a number in the 80% range “seems right.”\n\nAnalysts are already calling the development a positive step in the right direction.\n\n“While the details and framework for the US/China trade deal will be key and discussed tomorrow morning, this is a huge positive in the right direction for the markets and more progress has come out of these Swiss talks than even the bulls were hoping for heading into Friday night,” Wedbush tech analyst Dan Ives said Sunday following the news."

    "full_content": "When it comes to real estate, Mark Zuckerberg doesn’t just buy a house—he buys the whole block. Or at least a sizable chunk of it.\n\nSure, the Meta CEO owns the kind of Silicon Valley compound you’d expect from a tech titan. But as his fortune has grown to the tune of $212 billion, per The Bloomberg Billionaires Index, so has his appetite for land—and lots of it. From a sprawling compound in Hawaii with whispers of a luxury doomsday bunker to a San Francisco pied-à-terre that underwent a multimillion-dollar glow-up before being offloaded for $31 million, Zuckerberg’s portfolio is less about keeping up with the tech-crowd Joneses and more about building his own ultra-private universe. Think of it less as house hunting and more as a masterclass in billionaire nesting.\n\nIn classic Zuck fashion, his private domains are huge, heavily upgraded, extensively fortified, and often surrounded by other properties he’s scooped up for the sake of privacy. Some of his holdings are well-known, others are more elusive, like his rumored N.Y.C. apartments and other quietly acquired properties across the U.S. Buckle in as we take a closer look at where Zuckerberg, his wife Priscilla Chan, and their family hang their many hats.\n\nPalo Alto Properties\n\nThe Facebook founder’s primary residence in Palo Alto is less of a single home and more of a meticulously assembled mini compound, the result of a series of strategic purchases aimed at preserving privacy and control over his immediate surroundings.\n\nIt all started in March 2011, when Zuckerberg bought a 5,617-square-foot home on Edgewood Drive for $7 million. Just 10 minutes from the social media platform’s Menlo Park HQ, the five-bedroom, five-and-a-half-bath residence came with a saltwater pool, a glass-enclosed sunroom, and a sprawling backyard pavilion. A year later, around the time he and Chan tied the knot, Zuck turned his attention to the homes bordering his Edgewood estate.\n\nZuckerberg has spent over $43 million assembling his own private compound in Palo Alto. Google Earth\n\nIn 2012, he acquired a neighboring three-bedroom, three-bath home for $4.8 million, and the following year he doubled down—scooping up two additional residences for a combined $10.5 million in September and a four-bedroom abode in October for a cool $14.5 million.\n\nThe grand plan? To demolish four of the homes and create one seamless compound. Concerned about neighborhood character and housing scarcity, the city nixed his demolition proposal in 2016, CNBC reported. Instead, the tech mogul opted for renovations, reportedly leasing the properties back to their original owners in the meantime. All in, he shelled out over $43 million to stitch together his private slice of Palo Alto, now spread over 1.83 acres—a walled garden of tech, tranquility, and very expensive real estate.\n\nHawaii Holdings\n\nZuck’s real estate ambitions don’t stop at Silicon Valley or San Francisco; they stretch all the way to Kauai, where the Meta magnate is building what might be the most secretive (and extravagant) private estate in Hawaii.\n\nHe began his aloha chapter in 2014, when he quietly purchased two lush parcels on Kauai’s North Shore: the 357-acre Kahu’aina Plantation (a former sugarcane farm) for around $66 million and a majority stake in a 393-acre Pila’a Beach spread for roughly $49.8 million. Combined, the two properties total more than 700 acres and set him back about $116 million. That figure has since ballooned.\n\nZuckerberg’s holdings in Hawaii span roughly 1,400 acres, with a jaw-dropping price tag of $270 million. Google Earth\n\nOver the years, Zuck and Chan expanded their island holdings through a series of acquisitions, including 89 more acres in 2017 for $45 million and another 600 acres in 2021 from the conservation-focused Waioli Corporation for $53 million. That brings their total Hawaii holdings to around 1,400 acres, with the price tag adding up to an eye-popping $270 million—$170 million in land and another $100 million in construction costs, according to Wired.\n\nSo, what does one build with nearly $300 million and a mile-long NDA? As it turns out, a lot. Zuckerberg’s Kauai compound, dubbed Koolau Ranch, is said to include two mansions spanning about 57,000 square feet, boasting a whopping 30 bedrooms and 30 bathrooms, plus an industrial kitchen, conference rooms, and multiple elevators—because stairs are for start-ups. The homes are connected by a tunnel leading to a 5,000-square-foot underground shelter, reportedly equipped with an escape hatch, a library, and bomb shelter-style steel-and-concrete doors. Zuckerberg has downplayed the bunker rumors, describing it as “a little shelter,” but the intrigue remains.\n\nThe rest of the estate reads like a luxury summer camp on steroids: guest houses, a tennis court, multiple swimming pools, a gym and sauna, a hot tub and cold plunge, and 11 treehouses connected by rope bridges. And in true off-grid fashion, the compound is said to be fully self-sufficient, with provisions for food and water. The entire property is wrapped in a six-foot-high wall, shielding it from curious passersby and perhaps adding to the legend of what’s quietly becoming one of the most ambitious—and enigmatic—private estates in the world.\n\nLake Tahoe Compound\n\nIn classic Zuckerberg fashion, the billionaire rapidly scooped up two neighboring estates totaling about 10 acres on the pristine west shore of the lake —one in December 2018 for $22 million and the other just a few weeks later for $37 million. The deals were done secretly under a veil of nondisclosure agreements and an LLC called Golden Range, according to property records.\n\nThe first of the two, the storied Carousel Estate, sits on 3.5 acres and boasts 200 feet of lake frontage, a private marina-style pier, and enough towering old-growth trees to make it feel like your own national park. At the time he acquired it, the estate included an eight-bedroom main house, a three-bedroom guesthouse, and a caretaker’s apartment. Despite its charm, the nearly century-old residence was deemed not historically significant and has since been torn down to make way for something far more grand, SFGate has reported.\n\nThe Meta CEO spent around $59 million on two adjoining lakefront estates in Lake Tahoe Joe Sohm/Visions of America/Universal Images Group via Getty Images\n\nNext door, the Brushwood Estate brought another six acres to the party, with 400 feet of shoreline and a private pier. This was no sleepy Tahoe lodge—it once hosted glitzy soirées like an Oscar de la Renta fashion show and the Lake Tahoe Summer Music Festival.\n\nBoth properties are being transformed into what planning documents describe as a seven-building compound designed to blend rustic elegance with cutting-edge luxury. At the heart of it all is a 20,000-square-foot, 35-foot-tall main residence, shaped like an L, clad in timber and glass, and crowned with a shingled roof.\n\nAll in the compound will have over 75,000 square feet of developed space that will include a gatehouse, a gym, a couple of guesthouses and a bunkhouse, a lakeside spa, and a home office.\n\nAcross the property are stone walkways, bridges, and nature trails that weave through the landscape, offering serene strolls with postcard-ready views of Lake Tahoe’s crystal-clear waters and snow-capped peaks. Zuckerberg’s Tahoe hideaway may not be as vast or headline-grabbing as his deluxe bunker in Hawaii, but it’s just as ambitious.\n\nD.C. Mansion\n\nZuckerberg’s newest real estate addition isn’t on the California coast, a Hawaiian island, or one of the country’s most expensive lakes—it’s in the heart of the nation’s capital, where hordes of billionaires have been flocking since the 2024 election. In March 2025, the social media mogul plunked down $23 million in cash for a striking 15,400-square-foot mansion in the exclusive Massachusetts Avenue Heights neighborhood—making it one of the top three most expensive residential sales in the district’s history.\n\nDesigned by renowned architect Robert Gurney, the residence has been hailed for marrying classic East Coast elegance with a clean, modern sensibility. Think brick façade, gabled roofs, tall chimneys, and steel-framed windows—a nod to traditional D.C. style—but inside, the vibe is all sleek lines, natural light, and architectural precision.\n\nIn March 2025, Zuckerberg shelled out $23 million in cash for his new home in Washington, D.C. Anice Hoachlander\n\nInterestingly, it was originally built for a couple known for hosting major events and fundraisers, so the layout is equal parts family-friendly retreat and diplomatic party central. For Zuckerberg, it’s another strategic foothold—equal parts personal sanctuary and political base camp.\n\nTrue to form, the purchase was wrapped in secrecy but eventually confirmed by Meta, which said the home would allow Zuckerberg to “spend more time [in D.C.] as Meta continues the work on policy issues related to American technology leadership.” And, if his real estate past is an indicator of the future, Zuckerberg may have his eye on some of the surrounding homes, too."

    "full_content": "José Andrés Group is betting that full control of hotel dining and design can turn culinary branding into a profitable hotel business.\n\nEvery weekday, Daily Departure brings you the most important travel industry story of the day — straight from the Skift newsroom. No fluff. Just the insights that move our industry. Every weekday,brings you the most important travel industry story of the day — straight from the Skift newsroom. No fluff. Just the insights that move our industry. More Daily Departure Episodes\n\nCelebrity chef José Andrés is breaking into the hotel sector with a branded hotel slated to open in Washington, D.C.\n\nThe Bazaar House by José Andrés is scheduled to open in 2027 in the capital city's Georgetown neighborhood. The project is the first branded hotel deal for José Andrés Group, known for its network of 40 buzzy restaurants, and is developed through a strategic licensing agreement with real estate firm Thor Equities.\n\n“No matter how luxurious you make a hotel, it's four walls and it's soulless, until you program the F&B,” said Sam Bakhshandehpour, who became global CEO of the José Andrés Group in 2024.\n\nNobu, another chef-driven brand, has grown to 19 hotels across eight countries,\n\nThe Bazaar House will include a 67-room hotel, a private membership club, wellness facilities, retail, and multiple restaurants.\n\nListen to This Podcast\n\nFrom Restaurants to Hotels\n\nJosé Andrés Group will license its brand and oversee programming, particularly around food, beverage, design, and guest experience.\n\n“What we're not looking to do is operate hotels,” Bakhshandehpour told Skift. \"We welcome partnering with the major operators, our existing partners, Marriott, Hilton, and Hyatt. Let them do what they do best, which is fill the rooms and operate the hotel.\"\n\n“Let us design it, let us create that ethos. Let us tell the stories and deliver that guest experience that's unique, and then let them leverage their machine.”\n\nWhile many hotels treat restaurants as secondary, Bakhshandehpour believes a fully integrated approach can change how a property is valued and perceived.\n\n“We want to be a successful experiential element that [hotel guests] look forward to,\" he said.\n\nWhat's Different About The Bazaar House\n\nThe first hotel is named after The Bazaar, Andrés' restaurant that debuted in Los Angeles in 2008 and has expanded to three other U.S. cities.\n\nBut not every hotel will carry The Bazaar branding. José Andrés Group will reserve The Bazaar name for luxury markets while introducing more affordable concepts elsewhere.\n\nA philosophy across all properties will be designing lobbies as \"destinations\" rather than mere thoroughfares, enticing guests to linger for business meetings and socializing.\n\nThe D.C. hotel will extend beyond dining to include an exclusive penthouse club, various food venues, and wellness spaces.\n\nA membership club will occupy part of the property. But that's not the start of a global network.\n\n\"It's very localized to D.C.,\" Bakhshandehpour said. \"We're not looking to get into the members club space … It's really earmarking a portion of the Bazaar House in Georgetown for guests that want to have that member's experience.\"\n\nJosé Andrés Group plans to add hotels in the U.S. and internationally. However, the CEO does not have other JAG-branded hotels in the works.\n\nRunning F&B for Hotels\n\nManaging services at hotels not branded with its name remains the company's bread-and-butter.\n\nAt the Andaz Miami Beach, José Andrés Group will oversee all food and beverage operations, including the new Mediterranean restaurant Aguasal, a Bazaar concept (previously at the SLS South Beach), and a Bar Centro cocktail bar. The group will also manage event and banquet services.\n\nThe group is exploring brand licensing, with particular interest from Middle Eastern partners. While international announcements remain pending, José Andrés Group is focusing on domestic growth in key cities like New York, Washington D.C., Miami, and Los Angeles, with an eye on emerging cultural and economic hubs.\n\n\"It's the Austins, the Nashvilles, the Scottsdales of the world,\" he said. \"I was recently in Palo Alto, and you look at the vibrancy of what's come back in Silicon Valley with the university, and you know that these are cities that have thought leaders. What's missing is a unique hotel product.\""
