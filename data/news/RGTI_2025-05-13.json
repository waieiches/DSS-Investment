    "full_content": "D-Wave Quantum (QBTS) stock soared on Thursday after the quantum computing company reported record revenue and a narrower loss in the first quarter.\n\nD-Wave reported first-quarter revenue of $15 million, a 509% increase from a year ago. The surge in revenue was driven by the sale of an Advantage quantum computing system to Germany’s Jülich Supercomputing Centre. D-Wave’s net loss narrowed to $5.4 million, or 2 cents a share, from $17.3 million, or 11 cents per share, last year.\n\nD-Wave finished the quarter with a record consolidated cash balance of $304.3 million, an amount that management expects will be sufficient to fund the company until it’s profitable.\n\nLatest Quarter 'Most Significant in D-Wave's History,' CEO Says\n\n“The first quarter of 2025 was arguably the most significant in D-Wave’s history,” said CEO Alan Baratz. The company, he said, “became the first to demonstrate quantum supremacy over classical computing on a useful real-world problem” with a peer-reviewed paper published in the scientific journal Science in March.\n\nQuantum computing stocks stepped into the spotlight late last year when Alphabet (GOOG) debuted a quantum computing chip called Willow, which the company claimed can complete computations orders of magnitude faster than the most advanced non-quantum chips. Since then, quantum stocks, including D-Wave, Rigetti Computing (RGTI), and Quantum Computing (QUBT), have been volatile amid highly speculative trading.\n\nD-Wave shares were up more than 50% at $10.44 in recent trading on Thursday, approaching their record high of $11.95. Shares of competitors Rigetti and Quantum Computing were up 11% and 19%, respectively."
