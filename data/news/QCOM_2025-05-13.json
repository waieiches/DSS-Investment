    "full_content": "Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and his team got an early foothold in the AI chip market — but now, they have competition.\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang and his team got an early foothold in the AI chip market — but now, they have competition. I-Hwa Cheng/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.\n\nNvidia is undoubtably dominant in the AI semiconductor space. Estimates fluctuate, but the company has more than 80% market share by some estimates when it comes to the chips that reside inside data centers and make products like ChatGPT and Claude possible.\n\nThat enviable dominance goes back almost two decades, when researchers began to realize that the same kind of intensive computing that made complex, visually stunning video games and graphics possible, could enable other types of computing too.\n\nThe company started building its famous software stack, named Compute Unified Device Architecture or CUDA, 16 years before the launch of ChatGPT. For much of that time, it lost money. But CEO Jensen Huang and a team of true believers saw the potential for graphics processing units to enable artificial intelligence. And today, Nvidia and its products are responsible for most of the artificial intelligence at work in the world.\n\nThanks to the prescience of Nvidia's leadership, the company had a big head start when it came to AI computing, but challengers are running fast to catch up. Some were competitors in the gaming or traditional semiconductor spaces, and others have started up from scratch.\n\nAMD\n\nAMD, led by CEO Lisa Su, lags behind Nvidia but remains its most serious competitor. I-Hwa Cheng/AFP via Getty Images\n\nAMD is Nvidia's top competitor in the market for AI computing in the data center. Helmed by its formidable CEO Lisa Su, AMD launched its own GPU, called the MI300, for the data center in 2024, more than a full year after Nvidia's second generation of data center GPUs started shipping.\n\nThough experts and analysts have touted the chip's specifications and potential based on its design and architecture, the company's software is still somewhat behind that of Nvidia, making these chips somewhat harder to program and use to their full potential.\n\nAnalysts predict that the company has under 15% market share. But AMD executives insist that they are committed to bringing its software up to par and that future expectations for the evolution of the accelerated computing market will benefit the company — specifically, the spread of AI into so-called edge devices like phones and laptops.\n\nQualcomm, Broadcom, and custom chips\n\nAlso challenging Nvidia are application-specific integrated circuits or ASICs. These custom-designed chips are less versatile than GPUs, but they can be designed for specific AI computing workloads at a much lower cost, which have made them a popular option for hyperscalers.\n\nThough multipurpose chips like Nvidia's and AMD's graphics processing units are likely to maintain the largest share of the AI-chip market in the long term, custom chips are growing fast. Morgan Stanley analysts expected the market for ASICs to double in size in 2025.\n\nCompanies that specialize in ASICs include Broadcom and Marvell, along with the Asia-based players Alchip Technologies and MediaTek.\n\nMarvell is in part responsible for Amazon's Trainium chips while Broadcom builds Google's tensor processing units, among others. OpenAI, Apple, Microsoft, Meta, and TikTok parent company ByteDance have all entered the race for a competitive ASIC as well.\n\nRelated stories Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\n\nAmazon and Google\n\nWhile also being prominent customers of Nvidia, the major cloud providers like Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud Platform, often called hyperscalers, have also made efforts to design their own chips, often with the help of semiconductor companies.\n\nAmazon's Trainium chips and Google's TPUs are the most scaled of these efforts and offer a cheaper alternative to Nvidia chips, mostly for the companies' internal AI workloads. However, the companies have shown some progress in getting customers and partners to use their chips as well. Anthropic has committed to running some workloads on Amazon's chips, and Apple has done the same with Google's.\n\nIntel\n\nIntel and its Gaudi line of AI chips has struggled to compete with Nvidia and AMD. Mandel Ngan/AFP via Getty Images\n\nOnce the great American name in chip-making, Intel has fallen far behind its competitors in the age of AI. But, the firm does have a line of AI chips called Gaudi that some reports have said can stand up to Nvidia's in some respects.\n\nIntel installed a new CEO, semiconductor veteran Lip-Bu Tan, in the first quarter of 2025 and one of his first actions was to flatten the organization so that the AI chip operations reports directly to him.\n\nHuawei\n\nThough Nvidia's American hopeful challengers are many, China's Huawei is perhaps the most concerning competitor of all for Nvidia and all those concerned with continued US supremacy in AI.\n\nHuang himself has called Huawei the \"single most formidable\" tech company in China. Reports that Huawei's AI chip innovation is catching up are increasing in frequency. New restrictions from the Biden and Trump administrations on shipping even lower-power GPUs to China have further incentivized the company to catch up and serve the Chinese markets for AI. Analysts say further restrictions being considered by the Trump administration are now unlikely to hamper China's AI progress.\n\nStartups\n\nAlso challenging Nvidia are a host of startups offering new chip designs and business models to the AI computing market.\n\nThese firms are starting out at a disadvantage, as they don't have the full-sized sales and distribution machines decades of chip sales in other types of tech bring. But several are holding their own by finding use cases, customers, and distribution methods that are attractive to customers based on faster processing speeds or lower cost. These new AI players include Cerebras, Etched, Groq, Positron AI, Sambanova Systems, and Tenstorrent, among others."

    "full_content": "is a senior editor and author of Notepad , who has been covering all things Microsoft, PC, and tech for over 20 years.\n\nMicrosoft has brought me inside the Surface hardware lab from time to time over the years, showing me how its engineers test the hinges and fabrics that go into its products. They’re usually typical engineering demonstrations, but last month I was invited to Microsoft’s headquarters in Redmond, Washington, to see how the company built its two new smaller Surface Pro and Surface Laptop devices. And this time around, I was pleasantly surprised to be shown how Microsoft uses magnets, robots, drop tests, and smoke to perfect its laptop and tablet designs.\n\nThe first stop on the tour led me inside Microsoft’s advanced prototype center, where Surface engineers are constantly creating prototypes to refine the fit and finish on a new product like the Surface Pro 12-inch. One of the new challenges for this device was getting the Surface Pen to attach to the rear of the tablet — and stay there.\n\nMicrosoft stress tests its Surface Slim Pen on a Surface Pro 12-inch. Image: Vjeran Pavic / The Verge\n\nMicrosoft wanted the stylus to attach with one hand but still be tough enough to stay in place when you slide it into a backpack. Engineers designed different magnet combinations, then tested their effectiveness with machines that record the force and distance needed to remove the pen. The team then tweaked their tests and designs to make sure there was a consistent feel on every single Surface Pro.\n\nThis same testing is used for the hinge design and magnetic keyboard. Microsoft has created a variety of tests to measure pass and fail rates on prototypes of keyboards to make sure they can attach at multiple angles. That’s particularly important on a smaller keyboard, and it’s something I’m going to be testing myself when I review the Surface Pro 12-inch.\n\nMicrosoft has also been obsessing over performance and battery life on its Qualcomm-powered Surface Laptop devices over the past year, touting them as MacBook Air killers. While the new Surface Pro has moved to a fanless design, Microsoft is sticking with a fan on the new 13-inch Surface Laptop to help cool the chips inside and provide competitive performance. As there’s a fan inside, Microsoft has had to simulate airflow through the cooling system to ensure its prototypes are hitting their targets without throttling too soon.\n\nThe smoke test lets Surface engineers see how airflow is working on a Surface Laptop 13-inch. Image: Vjeran Pavic / The Verge\n\nSurface engineers use smoke to do this, much like how a number of PC gaming YouTubers demonstrate the airflow of modern case designs in the same way. Smoke gets pumped through the intake vents and outputs through the rear to show where the airflow might be getting blocked by a part of the device and not performing as optimally as possible. Airflow is even more important on a smaller device, where the thermals are more constrained.\n\nOnce Microsoft’s engineers are happy with the level of cooling, the fan prototype then gets tested inside a thermal chamber. The temperature is set to 35 degrees Celsius, around 95 Fahrenheit, to see how well the fan and cooling performs at this kind of heat. Microsoft measures areas like the palm rest part of a laptop to ensure they’re staying within the thermal limits and that the device is still comfortable to use. Engineers also look at hot spots with FLIR thermal imaging cameras to ensure the laptop isn’t overheating anywhere.\n\nPrecision thermal and Surface Pen tests are interesting, but they’re not as much fun as good old-fashioned real-world violence. Microsoft showed me how it experiments with its Surface devices by dropping them and smashing them up. I haven’t seen a drop test on a Surface lab tour since the early days of Microsoft’s tablets, so I was pleased to see the company was brave enough to attempt one again.\n\nA drop chamber is designed to validate Microsoft’s simulation data against the reality of dropping a device on concrete flooring. The drop chamber was key to developing Microsoft’s removable battery packs on its latest Surface devices, for example, to ensure any drops wouldn’t puncture the batteries.\n\nMicrosoft says that dropping its Surface Pro 12-inch from a height of two meters onto a hardwood floor does not cause any significant damage, but when it demonstrated the same test on a concrete floor it dented in front of my eyes. It was still functional, but part of the chassis had buckled under the pressure of the concrete. A few years ago I accidentally dropped a Surface Pro review unit in a similar way and the screen cracked, so hopefully these drop tests mean the latest model is even sturdier than before.\n\nWhen Microsoft isn’t busy dropping Surface prototypes, engineers also zap its tablets and laptops with electrical discharges. This ensures you don’t have any weird experiences with electrostatic discharges that could lead to software crashing or even a USB port failing. Microsoft tests above regulatory limits to make sure that extreme scenarios won’t kill its hardware. The company also has a special radio frequency chamber to test frequency interference in a sealed room.\n\nMy favorite part of the Surface labs tour was seeing Microsoft’s robots in action. The company has robots set up to tap the screens of its Surface prototypes 8,000 times to ensure the whole touch panel works every time and no touches are misregistered or inaccurate. The robot can even change the tool used to tap a screen to simulate different finger shapes.\n\nA robot creates a sketch of Microsoft’s 50th anniversary logo on a Surface Pro tablet. Image: Vjeran Pavic / The Verge\n\nOne room where I was led was full of robots, small and large. In the corner a larger robot was busy swiping away on a Surface screen to test that gestures work correctly. A few steps away another one made me smile while using the Surface Pen to draw. As it was Microsoft’s 50th anniversary, a robot arm was drawing a doodle to celebrate the company’s milestone. Smaller robots in the same room were testing palm rejection and tilting with the pen. If the robots ever do rise up, I wouldn’t want to be working in this room, that’s for sure.\n\nAfter admiring the robots, Microsoft led me into one of the quietest places on Earth: an anechoic chamber, which used to hold the world record for the world’s quietest place. The room is suspended and isolated from the room it’s inside of, which is also isolated away from the noise of Microsoft’s Surface buildings. Microsoft uses this room for audio testing, and it left me feeling like my ears were blocked up.\n\nI stood inside the anechoic chamber to hear how audio plays on Microsoft’s range of Surface Laptops, which have no visible speakers. Instead, audio is pumped out through the keyboard, something that’s unusual for a laptop. The audio team has had to tweak the design of the keyboard on the new 13-inch Surface Laptop so it doesn’t rattle or resonate when it’s pushing sound out the tiny gaps between the keys and the chassis. Microsoft could have just added regular speakers to its Surface laptops, but the team decided to engineer something clever to make extra space for the row of function keys.\n\nThat kind of attention to detail really sums up everything about Microsoft’s approach to hardware design with Surface. Over the past decade Microsoft has pushed the boundaries of what to expect from PC design, particularly with products like the Surface Book or Surface Studio.\n\nThese latest Surface devices may have only shrunk in size, but Microsoft’s lab tour demonstrated that there’s still a lot of engineering required to make them smaller. I really hope Microsoft’s meticulous approach to developing this new pair of Surface devices is a sign that the company is still committed to pushing the boundaries of hardware innovation — something Surface has become known for — to bring us more interesting and category-defining designs in the future.\n\nI’m always keen to hear from readers, so please drop a comment here, or you can reach me at notepad@theverge.com if you want to discuss anything else. If you’ve heard about any of Microsoft’s secret projects, you can reach me via email at notepad@theverge.com or speak to me confidentially on the Signal messaging app, where I’m tomwarren.01.

A series of ads from Qualcomm places the company's Snapdragon X processors squarely against the best from Intel.\n\n\"Here's a little intel on what's really inside,\" jabs one of the ads comparing a PC powered by Snapdragon to one powered by an \"unnamed\" CPU (that's clearly Intel).\n\nOne ad from Qualcomm focuses on figures, such as the fact that Snapdragon X chips run \"at max performance\" while Intel chips drop off in performance when unplugged.\n\nThat claim has merit, though some context is needed. While there are some PCs powered by Intel chips that drop performance to \"as little as 55%,\" it's common to see much smaller dips.\n\nThat same ad highlights the long battery life of PCs powered by Snapdragon as well.\n\nAnother ad is more direct in highlighting the 55% performance claim, showing spouses, soldiers, and CEOs only committing 55% effort.\n\nThe final ad drives home the same point, showing how PCs running at 55% performance when unplugged would affect office producitivy.\n\nGet the Windows Central Newsletter All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards.

(Image credit: Microsoft)\n\nPeople have dreamed of powerful and efficient computing for years, and many assumed ARM64 architecture would make those types of devices possible. The dream became a reality with the Snapdragon X series of chips.\n\nThe Snapdragon X Elite blew previous ARM64 chips away. The Snapdragon X Plus also delivered a nice midrange option that was also far beyond previous offerings.\n\nOur Senior Editor Zac Bowden said the following about the Snapdragon X Elite in our ASUS Vivobook S 15 review:\n\n\"So, does the Snapdragon X Elite live up to the hype? In short, it absolutely does. This chip is a beast, outputting incredible performance that you can feel in almost every task. Whether browsing the web with lots of tabs, multitasking through lots of open apps, rendering video and audio, hosting a podcast, or even some gaming, the Snapdragon X Elite can do it all.\"\n\nFor a while, PC manufacturers were hesitant to fully embrace PCs powered by ARM64 processors. But things have changed.\n\nThe list of the best Windows on Arm laptops now includes devices from Microsoft, Samsung, HP, and ASUS. And of course, those PCs are all powered by Snapdragon chips (though we could see ARM64 CPUs from NVIDIA at some point).\n\nConsumer-focused Surface devices, including the newly announced Surface Pro 12-inch and Surface Laptop 13-inch run on Snapdragon chips. Microsoft's flagship computers, the Surface Pro 11 and Surface Laptop 7 also have Snapdragon X chips inside.\n\nThere are versions of the Surface Pro 11 and Surface Laptop 7 with Intel chips, but those PCs are built for business users.\n\nMicrosoft has put extensive effort into optimizing Windows 11 for PCs powered by Snapdragon chips. Developers and major corporations have also optimized programs, greatly expanding the library of the best native Windows on Arm apps.\n\nLooping back to the ads from Qualcomm, that company's Snapdragon chips are the star of the show here. Any efforts from Microsoft would fall short without chips like the Snapdragon X Elite.\n\nNow that Windows PCs powered by Snapdragon chips are in the spotlight, Qualcomm seems eager to show its processors can go toe-to-toe with Intel CPUs."

    "full_content": "We recently published a list of 11 Most Promising Future Stocks According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) stands against other most promising future stocks to buy now.\n\nThe past year has seen investors pour money into futuristic trends such as electric vehicles and AI. These trends have raised the question of whether regulators will slow their growth in 2025 or attain more space to run with a green signal from the government. Venture Capitalist Bradley Tusk appeared on CNBC to talk about the industries that are expected to thrive in 2025 and how policy changes could affect investments across these hot industries.\n\nHe said that while some of the policies on big tech might continue, we would likely see a friendlier climate towards M&A activity and new technology in fintech, healthcare tech, and energy. The various factors are thus coming together well, especially in the world of venture capital. While it has not been all that vibrant there in the past few years, things are starting to turn around now.\n\nWhat Could the Future Look Like for AI?\n\nHowever, Tusk said that he does not feel confident that the current administration would provide the necessary safety and security while also letting technology get competitive. He provides Internet 2.0 as evidence, saying that we still have to regulate social media while we are a decade and a half into this experiment now. While we have a good idea of how to regulate AI, the federal and state-level authorities have not been particularly competent at broadly regulating new technologies. If you leave it to the state, you will likely get 50 different intellectual and analytical frameworks on regulating AI, which becomes almost impossible for the companies to comply with. Tusk thus opines that we could really use some competent leadership at the federal level, as these factors might be a potential hindrance to the upside of this technology.\n\nTalking further about the future of the AI industry, he said that people will likely continue to build an arms race in the area, and the momentum and excitement will continue irrespective of the circumstances. Companies in this area are so heavily invested that they have to keep investing no matter what. At the same time, AI is still a world of unfulfilled potential. There is a lot of talk about what it could be and how it could change the way we create new drugs, teach children, discover minerals, or anything else. But at some point, it has to go from a cool search engine and exciting potential idea to actual revenue and savings. Tusk said that this is the year it has to start being shown, as you can’t just forever continue investing for the potential that may come someday; at one point, the economics have to come in too."

If so, that means that under-screen Face ID could debut on the iPhone 18 Pro and iPhone 18 Pro Max next year.\n\nCiting its own sources, The Information this month also reported that the iPhone 18 Pro models will likely be equipped with under-screen Face ID.\n\n\n\nTop-Left Front Camera\n\nWith under-screen Face ID expected, the report from The Information said the iPhone 18 Pro and iPhone 18 Pro Max will have only a small pinhole in the top-left corner of the screen, to accommodate the front-facing camera.\n\nThe report said the devices will no longer have a pill-shaped cutout at the top of the screen, but it is unclear if the Dynamic Island will be discontinued.\n\n\n\nVariable Aperture\n\n\n\nThe main 48-megapixel Fusion camera on both iPhone 18 Pro models will offer variable aperture, according to analyst Ming-Chi Kuo.\n\nWith variable aperture, users would be able to control the amount of light that passes through the camera's lens and reaches the sensor. The main cameras on iPhone 14 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro, and iPhone 16 Pro models have a fixed aperture of ƒ/1.78, and the lens is always fully open and shooting with this widest aperture. With the iPhone 18 Pro models, users would be able to manually change the aperture, according to this rumor.\n\nA variable aperture on iPhone 18 Pro models should provide users with greater control over depth of field, which refers to how sharp a subject appears in the foreground compared to the background. However, given that iPhones have smaller image sensors due to size restraints, it is unclear exactly how meaningful this improvement would be.\n\n\n\nSamsung Image Sensor\n\n\n\nSamsung is developing a new three-layer stacked camera sensor that Apple is expected to use for iPhone 18 Pro models, according to DigiTimes. This advanced image sensor would make the iPhone 18's camera more responsive, and offer other benefits like reduced noise in photos, increased dynamic range, and more.\n\nThe exact technology is called \"PD-TR-Logic,\" according to a leaker known as \"Jukanlosreve\", and it refers to a camera sensor with three layers of circuitry affixed to it.\n\nSony has long been the exclusive supplier of image sensors for iPhone cameras, so Samsung entering the fray would be notable.\n\nIn July 2024, Kuo said he expected Samsung to begin shipping 48-megapixel Ultra Wide camera sensors to Apple for iPhones as early as 2026, which is when the iPhone 18 Pro models are expected to be released.\n\n\n\n12GB of RAM\n\niPhone 18 Pro models will be equipped with 12GB of RAM, according to Kuo. Increased memory bandwidth has also been rumored for the devices.\n\niPhone 16 Pro models are equipped with 8GB of RAM, while iPhone 17 Pro models and even the iPhone 17 Air are rumored to have 12GB of RAM.\n\n\n\nC2 Modem\n\n\n\nApple debuted its custom-designed C1 modem in the iPhone 16e a few months ago, as part of a multi-year plan to transition away from Qualcomm modems.\n\nApple's second-generation C2 modem will debut in the iPhone 18 Pro models next year, according to Jeff Pu, an analyst who covers companies within Apple's supply chain. Unsurprisingly, expect the C2 modem to be faster than the C1, and for it to gain mmWave support in the United States. Further power efficiency improvements are likely too.\n\n\n\nA20 Pro Chip (2nm)\n\n\n\nApple's A20 Pro chip for the iPhone 18 Pro models will be manufactured with TSMC's 2nm process, known as N2, according to Kuo.\n\nApple's latest A18 and A18 Pro chips for the iPhone 16 series use TSMC's second-generation 3nm process, while the A19 and A19 Pro chips for the iPhone 17 series are expected to use TSMC's third-generation 3nm process.\n\nThe move to a 2nm process starting with the A20 chips would allow for more transistors in each chip, which would boost performance. Specifically, reports indicate that A20 chips should be up to 15% faster and up to 30% more power efficient than A19 chips.\n\nAn overview of current and expected chips:\n\nA17 Pro chip: 3nm (TSMC's first-generation 3nm process N3B)\n\nA18 and A18 Pro chips: 3nm (TSMC's second-generation 3nm process N3E)\n\nA19 and A19 Pro chips: 3nm (TSMC's third-generation 3nm process N3P)\n\nA20 and A20 Pro chips: 2nm (TSMC's first-generation 2nm process N2)\n\nKeep in mind that these nanometer sizes are simply TSMC marketing terms, rather than actual measurements."

Pros Dual USB4, Surface Connect ports\n\nOptional 5G connectivity\n\nSuperior front camera\n\nMore powerful hardware options\n\nOptional OLED touch display is superior Cons Costs more\n\nNot as portable\n\nVented design not as sleek\n\nMicrosoft officially announced the new 12-inch Surface Pro on May 6, 2025, roughly a year after the first Copilot+ AI PCs — including the Surface Pro 11 — were unveiled.\n\nThe new Surface Pro 12-inch is essentially a standard Surface Pro PC with built-in stand and magnetic keyboard cover, all shrunk down to be more portable.\n\nI'm taking a close look at the new Surface Pro 12-inch to see how it compares to the Surface Pro 11, with aims to help you pick the perfect 2-in-1 laptop.\n\nSurface Pro 12-inch vs. Surface Pro 11: Specifications\n\nBefore getting into my analysis, here's a quick look at the specs you'll find in both 2-in-1 Surface PCs.\n\nSwipe to scroll horizontally Header Cell - Column 0 Surface Pro 12-inch Surface Pro 11 CPU Qualcomm Snapdragon X Plus (8 core) Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite (X1E-80-100), Snapdragon X Plus (X1P-64-100) RAM 16GB LPDDR5x 16GB, 32GB LPDDR5x GPU Qualcomm Adreno (integrated) Qualcomm Adreno (integrated) NPU Qualcomm Hexagon (45 TOPS) Qualcomm Hexagon (45 TOPS) Storage 256GB, 512GB UFS 256GB, 512GB, 1TB M.2 PCIe 4.0 NVMe SSD (upgradeable) Camera Front-facing 1080p + IR, rear-facing 10MP Front-facing 12.2MP + IR, rear-facing 10MP Speakers Dual 2W speakers, Dolby Atmos Dual 2W speakers, Dolby Atmos Display 12 inches, 2196x1464 (2.1K), 220 PPI, LCD, 3:2 aspect ratio, 90Hz, touch, 400 nits 13 inches, 2880x1920 (2.8K), 267 PPI, OLED or LCD, 3:2 aspect ratio, 120Hz, touch Ports Two USB-C 3.2 Two USB4, Surface Connect, Nano-SIM Wireless Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 5.4 Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 5.4, 5G (optional) Battery Up to 16 hours video playback OLED: 53Wh, LCD: 48Wh Dimensions 10.8 x 7.47 x 0.30 inches (274mm x 190mm x 7.8mm) 11.3 x 8.2 x 0.37 inches (287mm x 208.6mm x 9.3mm) Weight 1.5 pounds (686g) From 1.97 pounds (0.89kg) Colors Platinum, Ocean, Violet Platinum, Black, Sapphire, Dune Price From $799 From $1,000\n\nSurface Pro 12-inch vs. Surface Pro 11: Price and availability\n\nThe new Surface Pro 12-inch is now available to preorder starting at $799. It's expected to ship on May 20.\n\nMicrosoft's official store and Best Buy appear to be the best places to shop; the former has options for Student Discounts.\n\nThe $799 model includes an 8-core Snapdragon X Plus chip, 16GB of RAM, and 256GB of storage. It comes in a Platinum finish.\n\nThe $899 model has 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage, and it's available in Platinum, Violet, and Ocean colors.\n\nThe Surface Pro 12-inch keyboard also launched alongside the new 2-in-1 PC, and it comes in Slate, Ocean, and Violet colors. It costs $149 on top of the cost of the PC.\n\nThe Surface Slim Pen 2 is another perfect companion (but totally optional), and it adds another $130 to the total cost.\n\nFor example, if you opt for the $899 model, you'll spend $1,149 (plus taxes) for the full Surface Pro 12-inch experience, which includes the keyboard and pen.\n\nBy comparison, Surface Pro 11 (10-core, LCD, 512GB/16) with the keyboard and pen will set you back $1,509, or $360 more than a similar Surface Pro 12-inch configuration.\n\nThe Surface Pro 11 with attached keyboard and Slim Pen 2. (Image credit: Daniel Rubino)\n\nThe Surface Pro 11 generally starts at $999 for the PC alone, but it's often discounted.\n\nAt the time of writing, for example, a model with a 12-core Snapdragon X System-on-Chip (SoC), 16GB of RAM, and a 256GB SSD costs about $800 at Best Buy.\n\nSurface Pro 11 models range in price up to about $2,100 for a model with a 12-core Snapdragon X Elite SoC, 32GB of RAM, and a 1TB SSD.\n\nThe PCs come in Platinum, Sapphire, Dune, and Black colors. You can find the same colors for the Surface Pro Keyboards, which run at about $180. The Surface Slim Pen 2 works the same across Surface Pro 11 and Surface Pro 12-inch.\n\nAlso now available are Surface Pro 11 PCs with 5G connectivity to keep you connected everywhere you go.\n\nThe additional wireless connectivity can be configured at Microsoft's official site; models start at about $1,300.\n\nSurface Pro 12-inch vs. Surface Pro 11: Design and features\n\nMicrosoft wanted to build a Surface Copilot+ PC that's better suited for those always on the go, and the Surface Pro 12-inch is the result.\n\nMicrosoft was able to shave off about half a pound from the tablet's weight (1.5 pounds compared to 1.97 pounds), meanwhile cutting down on all dimensions elsewhere.\n\nThe Surface Pro 12-inch measures 10.8 x 7.47 x 0.30 inches, which seems a lot more \"tablet-y\" than the Surface Pro 11 and its 11.3 x 8.2 x 0.37 inches.\n\nThere's no fan required to keep the Surface Pro 12-inch cool, and Microsoft also removed any venting around the outside edges. It makes for a cleaner look compared to the Surface Pro 11, once again playing more into the modern \"slab\" aesthetic.\n\nThe new Surface Pro 12-inch is a sleek tablet available in three colors. (Image credit: Microsoft)\n\nBoth laptops use a built-in rear stand for positioning, which folds away cleanly when not in use. And just like the Surface Pro 11, the Surface Pro 12-inch has detachable magnetic keyboards that snap on and off with ease.\n\nWhereas the premium $349 Surface Pro Flex keyboard for the Surface Pro 11 features a haptic touchpad, Microsoft has stayed with a standard Precision touchpad on the Surface Pro 12-inch keyboards.\n\nThe Precision touchpad includes an adaptive touch mode, made to recognize other limbs and appendages when fingers aren't an option.\n\nThe new keyboards use Alcantara fabric along the hinge line, with the rest appearing to be a smooth matte finish. Keys are backlit, and the board can rotate fully around to lie flat against the back of the tablet.\n\nRather than lift and attach to the bottom bezel of the tablet (like on the Pro 11), Microsoft designed the new keyboards to snap on and leave the bottom edge of the tablet clear for better touch functionality.\n\nThe new keyboard has a fingerprint reader under the power button, adding to the tablet's built-in IR sensor for Windows Hello on the front camera.\n\nYou're going to get a premium typing experience from either option, although the Surface Pro 11's larger 13-inch size remains the best option for those with large hands. A 12-inch keyboard can feel cramped during marathon typing sessions.\n\nSome of the Pro 11's attachable keyboards include a dedicated charging cradle for the Surface Slim Pen 2, whereas Microsoft moved the slot to the back of the Surface Pro 12-inch.\n\nThe pen connects magnetically, and it charges wirelessly while in place. This won't likely be as secure as the Pro 11's solution, but there simply isn't enough room on the keyboard to add an internal cradle.\n\nThe Surface Pro 11 (pictured here) and Surface Pro 12-inch both have a built-in stand on the back. (Image credit: Daniel Rubino)\n\nThe Surface Pro 11's 12.2MP front camera should easily best the Pro 12-inch's 1080p front camera. However, rear cameras appear to be the same with 10MP each.\n\nThe audio setup is also similar, with both laptops offering dual 2W speakers and Dolby Atmos support.\n\nWindows Central Editor-in-Chief Daniel Rubino called the larger PC's audio \"rich and punchy\" in his Surface Pro 11 review, so I hope that continues in the Pro 12-inch despite its smaller size.\n\nPort selection has been thinned out on the Surface Pro 12-inch. Microsoft removed the Surface Connect port, so you'll have to use one of the two USB-C 3.2 (Gen 2) ports for charging some of the time.\n\nMicrosoft says one USB-C port can support up to two 4K monitors at 60Hz each, leaving the other free for charging.\n\nThe Surface Pro 11's port selection easily bests that of the Surface Pro 12-inch. Dual USB4 ports are equivalent to Thunderbolt 4 in terms of high-speed data transfers and video support; there's a separate Surface Connect hookup for charging, and a Nano-SIM slot is available on 5G models.\n\nThe Surface Pro 12-inch lacks 5G support, but connectivity is otherwise similar to the Pro 11 with Wi-Fi 7 and Bluetooth 5.4.\n\nSurface Pro 12-inch vs. Surface Pro 11: Display\n\nThe Surface Pro 11's optional OLED display is a feature not available in the new Surface Pro 12-inch. (Image credit: Daniel Rubino)\n\nThe new Surface Pro 12-inch unsurprisingly has a 12-inch LCD touch display. The smaller screen has a 2196x1464 resolution for its 3:2 aspect ratio, and that equates to 220 pixels-per-inch (PPI).\n\nIt has a 1200:1 contrast ratio, a refresh rate up to 90Hz, and it should top out at around 400 nits brightness. It's only available in LCD, so if you want OLED, you'll have to stick with the larger Pro 11.\n\nThere's also no mention of Dolby Vision on the Surface Pro 12-inch, so the Pro 11 is your best option if it's a necessity.\n\nThe Surface Pro 11's touch display at 13 inches hits a 2880x1920 resolution, coming out at a higher 267 PPI.\n\nIt's available with an LCD or an OLED panel, with the latter hitting an outstanding 1M:1 contrast ratio. Both have a dynamic refresh rate up to 120Hz, making for an overall smoother picture.\n\nThe Pro 11's displays have Dolby Vision IQ support, and in our testing, the OLED model hit 550 nits brightness. If you often work outside, having the ability to pump brightness higher with OLED (up to about 900 nits) should be a big deal.\n\nBoth PCs support inking with the Surface Slim Pen and Surface Slim Pen 2, with the latter offering haptic feedback when drawing or writing.\n\nSurface Pro 12-inch vs. Surface Pro 11: Performance and battery\n\nThe new Surface Pro 12-inch comes in a new Violet color. (Image credit: Microsoft)\n\nMicrosoft didn't create the Surface Pro 12-inch to outperform its flagship Surface Pro 11. Instead, it designed the new PC with \"flexibility and mobility in mind.\"\n\nPart of that initiative, as I mentioned, is the removal of any internal fans and perimeter venting.\n\nWhile it makes the tablet look a lot cleaner, it also means there isn't as much thermal capacity for Snapdragon's top chips. That's exactly why Microsoft is using an 8-core Snapdragon X Plus SoC inside.\n\nQualcomm currently offers two 8-core chips — X1P-46-100 and X1P-42-100 — and we're working to find out exactly which options are available in the Surface Pro 12-inch.\n\nThe good news is that both come with a Neural Processing Unit (NPU) capable of up to 45 TOPS of power for AI. That gives the Surface Pro 12-inch immediate access to Copilot+ AI tools in Windows 11.\n\nMicrosoft hasn't yet revealed the battery capacity of the Surface Pro 12-inch, but it's claiming up to 16 hours of local video playback and up to 12 hours of active web use.\n\nImage 1 of 3 On Crossmark we can see how Surface Pro 11 handles x86 app emulation compared to other x86 Windows 11 laptops. (Image credit: Future) While not the fastest PC the Surface Pro 11 does well on Geekbench v6.2. (Image credit: Future) For a more sustained and prolonged benchmark Cinebench 2024 (ARM64, x86) shows that Surface Pro 11 is quite competitive. (Image credit: Future)\n\nThat leaves the Surface Pro 11 as the top performer. It's available with a 10-core Snapdragon X Plus processor or a 12-core Snapdragon X Elite, the latter being the most powerful.\n\nThese chips both have an NPU with 45 TOPS of power for Copilot+, and the ability to get up to 64GB of RAM and up to 1TB of storage from the factory is key for power users.\n\nFor the Surface Pro 11, Microsoft claims up to 14 hours of local video playback, which is two hours less than the claims for the Surface Pro 12-inch.\n\n👉 Related: I finally tried Windows 11 on ARM after four years of unfairly dismissing Qualcomm's misunderstood platform (and I'm obsessed)\n\nIn reality, Surface Pro 11 reviewer Daniel Rubino saw an average of about 10 hours on a charge, and the new Surface Pro 12-inch should best that result due to its less powerful SoC inside.\n\nWhile RAM is soldered in both of these 2-in-1 tablets, storage is accessible for upgrades. The Surface Pro 11 has a quick-access hatch behind the stand; the Surface Pro 12-inch requires you to get inside the case the normal way.\n\nMicrosoft lists the Surface Pro 12-inch as using Universal Flash Storage (UFS), which is generally slower but more efficient than an SSD. It will be interesting to see how well it performs compared to the true SSD in the Surface Pro 11.\n\nI'll update this section as soon as I'm able to test the Surface Pro 12-inch performance.\n\nSurface Pro 12-inch vs. Surface Pro 11: Which should you buy?\n\nThe Surface Pro 11 remains the better option for anyone who values performance over portability. (Image credit: Daniel Rubino)\n\nMicrosoft's new Surface Pro 12-inch is a more affordable, more portable 2-in-1 PC that leans into the \"slab\" tablet design.\n\nThe fanless, ventless design looks super clean, the new colors are a nice addition for longtime Surface Pro users, and the built-in stand with attachable keyboard is immediately familiar.\n\nThere are some noticeable hardware downgrades in the more affordable 2-in-1 PC, including a lack of OLED display, a maximum 90Hz refresh rate for the LCD display, fewer ports, and a 1080p front camera.\n\nThe Surface Pro 12-inch also isn't going to perform at the same level as the Surface Pro 11. However, with prices starting at $799 before any discounts, you can save some serious money.\n\nThe Surface Pro 11's flagship status isn't really threatened. It remains more powerful, it's available with an optional OLED touch display, and its Flex Pro keyboard with haptics is more impressive. You can even add 5G connectivity to some models.\n\nIt is, however, more expensive. Prices usually start at $999, and that doesn't include an OLED panel or Snapdragon X Elite chip.\n\nOnce you add the more powerful SoC, OLED display, and scale up RAM and storage, prices quickly rise to beyond $2,000.\n\nBottom line? Stick with the Surface Pro 11 if you value power and display quality. Stick with the Surface Pro 12-inch if you value portability and don't mind losing out on some of the top-end performance.\n\nNew 12\" model Surface Pro 12-inch Check Amazon View at Best Buy Microsoft's new Surface Pro 12-inch is made to be a more portable alternative to the Surface Pro 11. It sacrifices some power, ports, and pixels to achieve its goal, but it's the right 2-in-1 choice for anyone who's on the go or who prefers a more streamlined tablet experience."

    "full_content": "Why you can trust Windows Central Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about how we test.\n\nYesterday, Microsoft unveiled the Surface Pro 12-inch and Surface Laptop 13-inch, both full-fledged Copilot+ PCs priced lower by removing some of the premium aspects of the bigger Pro models.\n\nI’ve spent all day with my Surface Pro 12-inch review unit, and I figured I’d share some of my experiences and common questions about it.\n\nIf I missed anything you want to know, let me know in the comments so I can address it in my full review. This will help determine if the Surface Pro 12-inch makes our perfect 2-in-1 laptop list.\n\nLet’s get to it!\n\nSurface Pro 12-inch performance\n\nSurface Pro 12-inch (left) and Surface Pro 13-inch (right), with slightly different blue colorways. (Image credit: Future | Daniel Rubino)\n\nI’ve been a big fan of Qualcomm’s Snapdragon X series of chips and have used the middle-tier Snapdragon X Plus on a few devices.\n\nSo, how does it fare in the Surface Pro 12-inch, which has no fan or vents?\n\nIt’s awesome.\n\nThe Qualcomm Snapdragon X Plus SoC crushes 2020's Surface Pro X and Surface Go. Indeed, Geekbench 6 scored the Surface Pro 12-inch at 2,422 on single-core and 11,080 on multicore.\n\nHow does that compare? On my 2024 HONOR 14-inch laptop with an Intel Core Ultra 7 155H series processor, Surface Pro 12-inch is faster on single-core (2,344) and a smidge slower on multi-core (11,427).\n\nBut the difference? The Surface Pro 12-inch is fanless, has no vents, and has better battery life! And Snapdragon X Plus only has 8 cores, while Intel has 16.\n\nThat’s seriously impressive considering how bad Surface Go and Pro X were then. It also performs within the range of other Snapdragon X Plus processors, like the larger ASUS ZenBook A14 (updated review coming soon).\n\nSwipe to scroll horizontally Spec Surface Pro 12-inch Processor Snapdragon X Plus 8-Core (XIP-42-100) Graphics Qualcomm Adreno (integrated) RAM 16GB LPDDR5X Storage 256/512GB UFS Display 3:2 12-inch IPS 90hz (2196 x 1464), 220 PPI NPU Qualcomm Hexagon (45 TOPS) Ports Two USB-C 3.2 Connectivity Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 5.4 Battery Up to 16 hours video playback Audio Dual 2W speakers, Dolby Atmos Camera Front-facing 1080p + IR, rear-facing 10MP Dimensions 10.8 x 7.47 x 0.30 inches (274mm x 190mm x 7.8mm) Weight 1.5 pounds (686g) Colors Platinum, Ocean, Violet Price From $799\n\nIn short, it’s swift and responsive. This chip is fantastic in this device.\n\nOf course, I’ll do more benchmarks for the review, including sustained tasks, to see how performance drops once the thermals increase. But for everyday tasks like web, video, Slack, email, Office, AI tools, photo editing, etc. I have no complaints.\n\nSurface Pro 12-inch vs. Surface Pro 11?\n\nSurface Pro 12-inch (left) and Surface Pro 13-inch (right), with slightly different blue colorways. (Image credit: Future | Daniel Rubino)\n\nSince there is only one inch difference in display size between the Surface Pro 13-inch (11th Edition) and the Surface Pro 12-inch, as you could imagine, it’s not a massive difference.\n\nIt’s as you’d expect. It's slightly smaller, lighter, and nimble, and slides easily into smaller bags.\n\nThe most significant difference is in the display, with the outstanding Surface Pro 11's OLED being noticeably better (and more expensive).\n\n\n\nYou can read more in our new guide: Surface Pro 12-inch vs. Surface Pro 11: Which 2-in-1 Copilot+ PC is better for you? or check out my full Surface Pro 11 review.\n\nIs the Surface Pro 12-inch display good?\n\nThe 12-inch Surface LCD with rounded, ventless chassis is slightly thinner than Surface Pro 11 (13-inch). (Image credit: Future | Daniel Rubino)\n\nIt’s OK, if not great. For this price, I expect the 2196x1464 (2.1K), 220 PPI, LCD, 3:2 aspect ratio, 90Hz refresh (60Hz by default), and 400 nits of brightness.\n\nBeing a lower-cost display, there is some minor ghosting, and I wish the color saturation were higher (even on Enhanced), but overall, it’s solid and above average.\n\nBut make no mistake, Surface Pro 11’s top-tier OLED panel crushes it by comparison!\n\nIt ships at 150% scale, but I had to bump it to 175% for easier reading.\n\nOverall, the Surface Pro's 12-inch display, quality, and size feel like those of a slightly larger 11-inch Apple iPad.\n\nWhat about Surface Pro 12-inch as a tablet?\n\nThe \"Ocean\" blue color is more sublte than Surface Pro 11's \"Sapphire\" blue. (Image credit: Future | Daniel Rubino)\n\nI don’t use my Surface much like a tablet alone, but going into the review, I’ll start to do that.\n\nInitial impressions are that it’s fine. It could always be lighter, and Windows 11 now has a better UX for tablets, though that too could be better. But for reading eBooks, the web, or just watching a video, some of this is mainly driven by the fact that the processor is now much faster, enhancing the overall experience.\n\n\n\nSame goes for battery life, which looks very promising.\n\nIs the Surface Keyboard with Slim Pen good?\n\nThe optional ($149) Surface keyboard for the new Surface Pro 12-inch tablet PC. (Image credit: Future | Daniel Rubino)\n\nMicrosoft always does well with keyboards, and I consider it one of the best in the laptop business.\n\n\n\nThe new Surface Pro 12-inch Keyboard with Slim Pen ($249; $149 without pen) is backlit, thankfully, and has an excellent trackpad. While it is slightly smaller, it’s nowhere near as cramped as Surface Go, which was just on the edge of usable.\n\nWriting on a 12-inch display is just fine. Letter-sized notebooks are around 11 inches, so you’re getting more space.\n\nIs the Surface Pen's magnet strong?\n\n(Image credit: Future | Daniel Rubino)\n\nIt’s powerful! The pen snaps into place and won’t budge until you yank it off. It’s also slightly recessed, which, combined with the flat Slim Pen, makes it very hard to knock off in your bag, so I don’t see that as an issue.\n\n\n\nMicrosoft did a great job here.\n\nAnything else about Surface Pro 12-inch?\n\nThe Surface 45-watt USB-C Wall Charger, while extra at $69, is extremely small. (Image credit: Future | Daniel Rubino)\n\nThe speakers—they’re excellent. While it doesn’t have Dolby Atmos support like the bigger Surface Pro 13-inch, it’s loud, crisp, and has fantastic spatial abilities.\n\n(Correction: The Surface Pro 12-inch does support Dolby Atmos. By default, Microsoft doesn't ship the Dolby Access app in the Microsoft Store, which lets you configure it. But if your PC supports Atmos, a licensing thing, the app enables you to adjust a few presets, like balanced, detailed, and more.)\n\nAlso, while not cheap at $69, the Surface 45-watt USB-C Wall Charger is super small with flappable prongs.\n\nThe big takeaway is that Qualcomm and Microsoft have finally made a fast tablet PC with an excellent battery life and no fan or vents. It’s what some of us have wanted for a very long time.\n\nOver to you! Ask me about Surface Pro 12-inch.\n\nBottom: Surface Pro 13-inch. Top: New Surface Pro 12-inch. (Image credit: Future | Daniel Rubino)\n\nI’ll save more thoughts for the full Surface Pro 12-inch review, but for now, ask me your questions in the comments—some of which I’ll answer here, and others I’ll include in the review!\n\nPre-orders for the Surface Pro 12-inch ($799) and Surface Laptop 13-inch ($899) are now live, and shipments are expected to begin on May 20.\n\n\n\nAs always, Microsoft also offers these devices to students at a discount, making these devices even cheaper than $799 and $899.\n\nAlongside the new Surface PCs, Microsoft has also announced a handful of new Windows experiences coming soon to Windows 11, including more Copilot+ AI features such as an AI agent in Windows Settings."

It arrives roughly a year after the first Copilot+ PCs — including the Surface Laptop 7 — made their debut.\n\nMicrosoft offers the Surface Laptop 7 in 13.8- and 15-inch sizes, and the new addition aims to be more portable with a 13-inch display.\n\nIt's the \"lightest, most portable Surface Laptop ever,\" designed for those who love taking a notebook PC everywhere they go.\n\nI compared the two existing Surface Laptop 7s with the new Surface Laptop 13-inch to help you get the perfect Windows laptop.\n\nSurface Laptop 13-inch vs. Surface Laptop 7: Specifications\n\nBefore I get too far into the detailed comparison between the Surface Laptop 13-inch and the Surface Laptop 7, here's a look at the raw specs available in both PCs.\n\nSwipe to scroll horizontally Header Cell - Column 0 Surface Laptop 13-inch Surface Laptop 7 CPU Snapdragon X Plus (8-core) Snapdragon X Elite (12-core), Snapdragon X Plus (10-core) RAM 16GB LPDDR5x 16GB, 32GB, 64GB LPDDR5x GPU Qualcomm Adreno Qualcomm Adreno NPU Qualcomm Hexagon (45 TOPS) Qualcomm Hexagon (45 TOPS) Storage 256GB, 512GB UFS 256GB, 512GB, 1TB M.2 PCIe 4.0 NVMe SSD (upgradeable) Camera 1080p + IR 1080p + IR Speakers Omnisonic speakers, Dolby Atmos Omnisonic speakers, Dolby Atmos Display 13 inches, 1920x1280 (178 PPI), 3:2 aspect ratio, 60Hz refresh rate, touch, 400 nits 13.8 inches, 2304x1536 (201 PPI), 3:2 aspect ratio, 120Hz dynamic refresh rate, touch, Dolby Vision IQ, HDR Row 8 - Cell 0 Row 8 - Cell 1 15 inches, 2496x1664 (201 PPI), 3:2 aspect ratio, 120Hz dynamic refresh rate, touch, Dolby Vision IQ, HDR Ports Two USB-C 3.2 (Gen 2), USB-A 3.1, 3.5mm audio (13.8-inch) Two USB4, USB-A 3.1, 3.5mm audio, Surface Connect Row 10 - Cell 0 Row 10 - Cell 1 (15-inch) Two USB4, USB-A 3.1, microSD card reader, 3.5mm audio, Surface Connect Wireless Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 5.4 Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 5.4 Battery Up to 23 hours local video playback; up to 16 hours active web usage 54Wh (13.8), 66Wh (15) Dimensions 11.25 x 8.43 x 0.61 inches (285.65mm x 214.14mm x 15.6mm) 11.85 x 8.67 x 0.69 inches (301mm x 220mm x 17.5mm) Row 14 - Cell 0 Row 14 - Cell 1 12.96 x 9.41 x 0.72 inches (329mm x 239mm x 18.29mm) Weight 2.7 pounds (1.22kg) 2.96 pounds (1.34kg) Row 16 - Cell 0 Row 16 - Cell 1 3.67 pounds (1.66kg) Colors Platinum, Violet, Ocean Sapphire, Dune, Black, Platinum Price From $899 From $1,000\n\nSurface Laptop 13-inch vs. Surface Laptop 7: Price and availability\n\nMicrosoft's new Surface Laptop 13-inch is now available to preorder. I found it at Microsoft's official store and at Best Buy, starting at $899.\n\nThe introductory model gets you the standard Snapdragon X Plus 8-core System-on-Chip (SoC), 16GB of LPDDR5x RAM, and 256GB of UFS storage; it's available in a Platinum finish.\n\nBumping the price up to $999 gets you 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage; these models come in Platinum, Violet, and Ocean colors.\n\nThe Surface Laptop 7 is split into 13.8- and 15-inch models. The smaller version normally starts at $999, but you can often find it on sale. It can be configured with a 10-core X Plus or 12-core X Elite SoC.\n\nThe smaller Laptop 7 tops out at about $2,400 for a model with an X Elite SoC, 64GB of RAM, and a 1TB SSD.\n\nThe 15-inch version, which starts at about $1,300, is available with the Snapdragon X Elite SoC only, and it starts at 16GB of LPDDR5x RAM and a 256GB SSD.\n\nYou can run it all the way up to a Snapdragon X Elite SoC with 64GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD for about $2,500, with plenty of other configs available along the way.\n\nThe new Surface Laptop 13-inch is the more affordable version by a good margin when everything is at full price. But whether or not it's the right option for you depends on important, design, display, and performance metrics.\n\nSurface Laptop 13-inch vs. Surface Laptop 7: Design and features\n\nA look at the colors available for the Surface Laptop 7. (Image credit: Windows Central)\n\nMicrosoft has essentially shrunk down the standard Surface Laptop to create the new 13-inch model, shaving off more than a half-inch of width, about a quarter inch of depth, and about 0.08 inches worth of thickness compared to the 13.8-inch model.\n\nThe difference is naturally much more pronounced when compared to the 15-inch Surface Laptop 7, as you can see in the spec table above.\n\nHowever, the new Surface Laptop 13-inch remains immediately recognizable as a Surface PC, with clean lines, rounded edges, and an organized layout for the keyboard and touchpad.\n\nOne of the bigger upgrades seen in the Surface Laptop 7 is the haptic touchpad that emulates physical clicks. It's a delight to use, and you can customize the click response to your liking.\n\nUnfortunately, the Surface Laptop 13-inch hasn't seen the same upgrade. It retains a mechanical touchpad, which all other Surface Laptops before the 2024 models used.\n\nThe keyboard on the Surface Laptop 13-inch is backlit, a feature the Surface Laptop Go 3, released in 2023, lacks.\n\nThe Surface Laptop 13-inch comes in Platinum, Ocean, and Violet colors. (Image credit: Microsoft)\n\n5G connectivity is not available in the Surface Laptop 7 or the new Surface Laptop 13-inch. Instead, the PCs rely on modern Wi-Fi 7 and Bluetooth 5.4 for a stellar wireless experience.\n\nFrom the specs that Microsoft has shared, it also appears that the speakers haven't changed. You still get dual Omnisonic speakers in the Surface Laptop 13-inch, with Dolby Atmos tuning included.\n\nThe camera falls under the same umbrella; no matter what, you get a 1080p front-facing webcam with an IR sensor for Windows Hello.\n\nI'll have more to share on these fronts once we've tested the new Surface Laptop 13-inch.\n\nI can, however, pull some quotes from Zac Bowden's Surface Laptop 7 review. He called the camera \"crisp and clear, with no visible artifacts or noise in normal lighting conditions.\"\n\nOn the subject of the audio, he says the speakers \"sound very good for a thin and light laptop such as this one, rivaling that of the MacBook Air.\"\n\nI don't suspect that will change much for the new Surface Laptop 13-inch, but I'll keep this guide updated with new findings.\n\nSurface Laptop 13-inch vs. Surface Laptop 7: Display\n\nA look at the Surface Laptop 7 15\" and its LCD touch display. (Image credit: Windows Central)\n\nThe new Surface Laptop 13-inch has a touchscreen with a 3:2 aspect ratio, just like its larger siblings.\n\nIt's sized at 13 inches with a 1920x1280 resolution, which comes out to 178 pixels per inch (PPI).\n\nAdaptive color and contrast keep things looking vivid, and Microsoft claims it'll reach up to 400 nits brightness.\n\nA 60Hz refresh rate is perhaps the biggest drawback, as Microsoft has cranked it up to a dynamic 120Hz on the Surface Laptop 7.\n\nAs mentioned, Microsoft offers the Surface Laptop 7 with 13.8- and 15-inch displays. With 2304x1536 (13.8\") and 2496x1664 (15\") resolutions, both have 201 PPI.\n\nContrast ratio is superior — 1400:1 (13.8\") and 1300:1 (15\") — to the Surface Laptop 13-inch at 1000:1. Dolby Vision IQ support is also included in both Surface Laptop 7 models.\n\nWindows Central Senior Editor Zac Bowden tested the display in his Surface Laptop 7 review, discovering about 600 nits of brightness.\n\nThat's not quite enough to combat the glossy finish when working outdoors, but it doesn't look like the new Surface Laptop 13-inch has an anti-reflective display, either.\n\nNone of these PCs offers inking support; the Surface Laptop 7 removed the feature, and the Surface Laptop 13-inch continues the trend.\n\nSurface Laptop 13-inch vs. Surface Laptop 7: Performance and battery\n\nThe Surface Laptop 7 is the right choice if you want the most performance possible. (Image credit: Windows Central)\n\nAs with the new Surface Pro 12-inch, the Surface Laptop 13-inch is powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon X Plus 8-core chips.\n\nMicrosoft claims this makes it 50% faster than the Surface Laptop 5 (which used 12th Gen Intel Core U-series CPUs), and it also claims it \"outpaces the MacBook Air M3.\"\n\nThe Surface Laptop 13-inch comes with only 16GB of LPDDR5x RAM, but you'll be able to choose between 256GB and 512GB of storage space.\n\nAnother important difference involves storage type. The Surface Laptop 13-inch uses UFS storage, whereas the Surface Laptop 7 uses a standard M.2 PCIe 4.0 NVMe SSD. The difference? UFS is generally slower but more efficient.\n\nStorage in all three of these PCs is upgradeable after purchase.\n\nI'll wait until we test the Surface Laptop 13-inch first-hand to make any solid performance claims, but I can surmise that the Surface Laptop 7 will remain the go-to choice for anyone who wants maximum power.\n\nYou can see in the graphs below how it compares in our testing to other laptops we've recently reviewed.\n\nImage 1 of 3 CrossMark is not natively compiled for Arm, but still earns a respectable score in benchmark results. (Image credit: Windows Central) A great result in Cinebench, but a slightly lower-than-expected multi-core score. (Image credit: Windows Central) Laptop 7 earns a great score on Geekbench. (Image credit: Windows Central)\n\nMicrosoft offers the 13.8-inch Surface Laptop 7 with either a 10-core Snapdragon X Plus or a 12-core Snapdragon X Elite SoC. The 15-inch model is tied to the 12-core X Elite chip.\n\nWith up to 64GB of LPDDR5x RAM and up to a 1TB M.2 PCIe 4.0 NVMe SSD, the Surface Laptop 7 remains the better option for power users.\n\nThe good news, despite the chip differences, is that all three PCs have a Neural Processing Unit (NPU) with up to 45 TOPS of power for local AI tasks.\n\nThis is beyond the 40 TOPS minimum requirement Microsoft has set for Copilot+, which means even the new Surface Laptop 13-inch has access on day one.\n\nAs for battery life, Microsoft claimed about 20-22 hours of video playback or 13-15 hours of active web usage for the Surface Laptop 7.\n\nI still don't know the exact capacity of the Surface Laptop 13-inch, but Microsoft claims 23 hours of local video playback and 16 hours of active web usage.\n\nConsidering reviewer Zac Bowden saw about 11-12 hours of battery life in real-world usage from the Surface Laptop 15 he tested, the new Surface Laptop 13-inch should offer about the same runtime.\n\nSurface Laptop 13-inch vs. Surface Laptop 7: Which should you buy?\n\nThe Surface Laptop 13-inch looks a lot like the Surface Laptop 7. (Image credit: Microsoft)\n\nThe new Surface Laptop 13-inch arrives at a more affordable price and with a more portable design.\n\nThis opens it up to a lot more users, whether they require the added mobility or they simply want to spend less and still get a Copilot+ with Surface-level quality design.\n\nThere are some caveats — lower screen resolution, UFS storage, less powerful Qualcomm chips, and 16GB of RAM maximum — but with prices starting at about $899, the Surface Laptop 13-inch should be an ideal PC for students, general use around the home or office, and travel.\n\nThe Surface Laptop 7 remains the best choice for those who want to maximize performance and screen resolution.\n\nIt's available with Qualcomm's Snapdragon X Plus (10-core) and X Elite (12-core) SoCs, and you can configure it with up to 64GB of RAM and a 1TB M.2 PCIe 4.0 NVMe SSD from the factory.\n\nBeyond that, the 120Hz display refresh rate and haptic touchpad help make up the price difference, so it's not like the Surface Laptop 7 is suddenly a bad buy.\n\nBottom line? The new Surface Laptop 13-inch should be a great device for a lot of people who don't want to spend flagship prices, but the Surface Laptop 7 remains the PC to beat if power and premium features are in your sights.\n\nNew 13\" model Surface Laptop 13-inch Check Amazon View at Best Buy The Surface Laptop 13-inch is the new best Surface PC for those on the go or who want to spend less. Its Snapdragon X Plus chip grants full access to Copilot+ tools, battery life looks to be excellent, and the new Ocean and Violet colors will certainly turn some heads."

    "full_content": "June 2024 marked the launch of the Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite to much initial fanfare for finally some compelling ARM laptop designs. While initially -- and still to this day with the likes of the TUXEDO X Elite laptop not materializing yet -- being focused on Windows 11 on ARM, there was hope among Linux users this would lead to a nice ARM Linux laptop experience, since after all Qualcomm and Linaro were working on enhancing the support for Linux. Now approaching the one year point, the overall state of the Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite support and performance is rather disappointing. Here's a look at where things currently are and performance relative to AMD Ryzen and Intel Core Ultra when making use of the latest Ubuntu Linux support.\n\nUbuntu Linux has been at the forefront of trying to provide a nice Qualcomm X Elite Linux experience. Going back months they've been shipping a Ubuntu 24.10 developer preview / concept image for use on the Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite laptops (Snapdragon X Plus isn't yet supported to the extent of the X Elite SoC) and Canonical engineers worked on more X1E improvements for Ubuntu 25.04. They've been relying in large part on the various Snapdragon X DeviceTree additions making it into the upstream Linux kernel and other kernel/driver upstream support work for enabling the X Elite SoC support and other components being found in the range of Microsoft Copilot+ AI ARM laptops.\n\nGiven the progress being made on the Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite laptop support under Ubuntu Linux and even with Ubuntu 25.04 now having a nice ARM64 desktop image, I decided to bite the bullet and buy a Snapdragon X Elite laptop finally for testing at Phoronix, with Qualcomm nor any of the other laptop vendors having stepped up in the nearly year since launch. I ended up buying the Acer Swift 14 AI laptop (SF14-11T-X3RZ). This Snapdragon X Elite X1E-78-100 laptop features the Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite SoC, 16GB of RAM, a 14.5-inch 2560 x 1600 120Hz 300 nits display, and 1TB NVMe SSD.\n\nThe Snapdragon X Elite X1E-78-100 SoC features 12 Oryon CPU cores, 42MB total cache, 3.4GHz maximum multi-core frequency without any boost frequency, and a Qualcomm Adreno GPU rated for 3.8 TFLOPS. The Snapdragon X Elite X1E-78-100 is paired with LPDDR5x-8448 MT/s memory.\n\nThe Acer Swift 14 AI SF14-11T has for months been supported by the Ubuntu X1E concept images and the other factor in picking this laptop for carrying out my Linux testing was being the most affordable option as of writing: the Acer SF14-11T-X3RZ can be found for $799 USD at some Internet retailers, a discount of $400 off the Acer list price. Used the Acer SF14-11T can be found for around $600+.\n\nAfter carrying out some Windows 11 on ARM tests for a future article, I then set out to see what the experience was like for the Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite now 11 months after launch. I started off using the Ubuntu 25.04 ARM64 desktop image given its new availability and how well that new ARM64 desktop image was working out on the System76 Thelio Astra. After disabling Secure Boot from the Acer BIOS setup screen, I set out to boot the Ubuntu 25.04 desktop ARM64 ISO off USB. As easy as x86_64!"

The Surface Go 4, which launched in 2023, is another compact 2-in-1 that launched in 2023.\n\nWhile Microsoft has stated that its new Pro 12-inch isn't replacing the Surface Go line — it's instead meant to add a more affordable option to its Copilot+ PC lineup — the newer 2-in-1 almost completely removes any enthusiasm and appeal for the Surface Go 4.\n\nShort story? Buy the Surface Pro 12-inch. Long story? Read on for a detailed breakdown of the differences and similarities between the Surface Pro 12-inch and Surface Go 4.\n\nSurface Pro 12-inch vs. Surface Go 4: Specifications\n\nBefore I dive into a more detailed breakdown, here's a look at the raw specs that make up these 2-in-1 Surface devices.\n\nSwipe to scroll horizontally Header Cell - Column 0 Surface Pro 12-inch Surface Go 4 CPU Qualcomm Snapdragon X Plus X1P-42 (8 core) Intel N200 RAM 16GB LPDDR5x 8GB LPDDR5 GPU Qualcomm Adreno (integrated) Intel UHD (integrated) NPU Qualcomm Hexagon (45 TOPS) None Storage 256GB, 512GB UFS 64GB, 128GB, 256GB UFS Camera Front-facing 1080p + IR, rear-facing 10MP Front-facing 1080p + IR, rear-facing 8MP Speakers Dual 2W speakers, Dolby Atmos Dual 2W speakers, Dolby Atmos Display 12 inches, 2196x1464 (2.1K), 220 PPI, LCD, 3:2 aspect ratio, 90Hz, touch, 400 nits 10.5 inches, 1920x1280, 220 PPI, LCD, 3:2 aspect ratio, 60Hz, touch, 350 nits Ports Two USB-C 3.2 USB-C 3.1, microSD card reader, Surface Connect, 3.5mm audio Wireless Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 5.4 Wi-Fi 6, Bluetooth 5.1 Battery Up to 16 hours video playback Up to 12.5 hours of typical device usage Dimensions 10.8 x 7.47 x 0.30 inches (274mm x 190mm x 7.8mm) 9.65 x 6.9 x 0.33 inches (245mm x 175mm x 8.3mm) Weight 1.5 pounds (686g) 1.15 pounds (521g) Colors Platinum, Ocean, Violet Platinum Price From $799 From $689.99\n\nSurface Pro 12-inch vs. Surface Go 4: Price and availability\n\nMicrosoft's new Surface Pro 12-inch is now available for preorder at Microsoft and third-party retailers, with the official launch slated for May 20, 2025.\n\nThe Surface Pro 12-inch with a Snapdragon X Plus (X1P-42) System-on-Chip, 16GB of RAM, and 256GB of storage starts at $799.99 at Best Buy. It comes in a Platinum finish.\n\nDoubling storage to 512GB, the price climbs to $899.99. Violet, Ocean, and Platinum colors are available for this pricier SKU.\n\nThe Surface Pro 12's optional keyboard is sold separately for $149.99. It comes in Slate, Violet, and Ocean colors.\n\nThe optional Surface Slim Pen 2 adds another $129.99 to the total. You can save some money by bundling the Pro 12-inch Keyboard and the Slim Pen for $249.99 at Best Buy.\n\nWith keyboard, pen, and PC, you're looking at spending about $1,050 for even the baseline package with 256GB of storage.\n\nThe Surface Go 4 launched in October 2023 and remains available to buy today via Microsoft's commercial storefront and some third-party retailers like Amazon.\n\nShopping at Microsoft, the Surface Go 4 \"for Business\" starts at $689.99. The baseline model gets you an Intel N200 processor, 8GB of LPDDR5 RAM, and 64GB of storage.\n\nThere's also a $799.99 model still on sale at Microsoft. It doubles the storage to 128GB, but specs are otherwise the same.\n\nAmazon seems to be one of the only other retailers selling the Surface Go 4 in an unused state.\n\nI found a model with 8GB RAM and 128GB storage for $819.99 at Amazon. I also found a model with 256GB of storage (sold out at Microsoft) for $964.99 at Amazon.\n\nMicrosoft sells its Surface Go Type Cover keyboard and Surface Pen separately. The best prices I found for the former are at Amazon. The Poppy Red option starts at $63, and prices climb from there for Platinum, Ice Blue, and Black colors.\n\nThe Surface Go 4 is made for use with the Surface Pen, which starts at about $60 at Amazon.\n\nTaking the best prices I could find, you're still adding about $123 to the cost of the PC for its accessories. That pushes the $690 model up to $813 for the full package with Surface Go 4, keyboard, and pen.\n\nBecause the device supports Microsoft Pen Protocol (MPP), you shouldn't have issues using Microsoft's newer Surface Slim Pen or Slim Pen 2, albeit without all the extra features like haptic feedback.\n\nSurface Pro 12-inch vs. Surface Go 4: Design and features\n\nA look at the back of the Surface Pro 12-inch. (Image credit: Future | Daniel Rubino)\n\nThe new Surface Pro 12-inch and the Surface Go 4 are both fanless 2-in-1 PCs. Because there aren't any fans inside, there's no necessary venting around the edges, making for a cleaner tablet aesthetic.\n\nThe Surface Go 4, despite its smaller display, is the chunkier device. Microsoft made a point of thinning down its Surface Pro 12-inch to match modern tablet slabs, and it's thinner than the Go 4 at 0.30 inches (compared to 0.33 inches).\n\nThe Go 4 has a smaller footprint, but not by a whole lot. The Surface Pro 12-inch measures about 1.15 inches wider and 0.57 inches taller.\n\nThe Go 4 also weighs less at 1.15 pounds compared to 1.5 pounds. Considering you get an additional 1.5 inches of screen space on the newer device, Microsoft did some fine work designing the Pro 12-inch.\n\nBoth Surface PCs feature a built-in stand on the back of the tablet. It extends out to stabilize and prop up the tablet, and it's especially important when a keyboard is attached.\n\nThe Surface Go 4 hides a microSD card reader under its stand, which can be used to expand its meager storage options.\n\nThe Go 4 otherwise offers one USB-C 3.1 port for data and video, Surface Connect for charging or Surface docks, and a 3.5mm audio jack.\n\nThe Surface Pro 12-inch has two USB-C 3.2 ports (10Gbps) only. It no longer includes Surface Connect, and it lacks a 3.5mm audio jack.\n\nThe Pro 12-inch can run dual 4K external monitors each at a 60Hz refresh rate with this setup.\n\nThe Go 4 can run one 4K display at 60Hz natively; for additional displays, a dock or extender with DisplayLink is required. Dan S. Charlton's Surface blog has an outstanding explanation of Surface USB-C capabilities if you want more info.\n\nThe Surface Go 4 is immediately recognizable as a Surface device. (Image credit: Future)\n\nBoth Surface PCs have a similar audio setup with dual 2W stereo speakers and Dolby Atmos tuning.\n\nCamera hardware is also similar. Both PCs have a front-facing 1080p camera with an IR sensor for Windows Hello facial recognition. The Pro 12-inch bumps its rear-facing camera to 10MP, while the Go 4 hits 8MP.\n\nThe Pro 12-inch has much newer wireless hardware, with Wi-Fi 7 and Bluetooth 5.4 offering the best possible experience. The Go 4 offers Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5.1; still good, but not as good.\n\nBoth devices use a detachable keyboard to complete the notebook setup. The Go 4's keyboard is smaller (I find it edging on too small, but my hands are probably larger than average), but it comes with a backlight.\n\nThe Pro 12-inch keyboard is slightly different. It still attaches magnetically, but the hinge is slimmer and no longer flips up to stick to the bottom bezel.\n\nThis allows it to rotate backwards to sit flat on the back of the tablet, but it also makes for a more streamlined look. The Pro 12-inch keyboard also features a backlight.\n\nMicrosoft added an indented cradle on the back of the tablet to house the Slim Pen when it's not in use. The pen charges automatically when cradled.\n\nThe new pen cradle on the Surface Pro 12-inch. (Image credit: Future | Daniel Rubino)\n\nPlatinum, Ocean, and Violet colors are available for the Surface Pro 12-inch. The Surface Go 4 is only available in Platinum, although its keyboards (linked in the section above) can add some flair.\n\nOverall, the Surface Pro 12-inch is immediately recognizable as the newer, more modern device.\n\nIt's slightly thinner, the keyboard has less bulk (and more typing space), and the new Slim Pen charging cradle is a nice feature.\n\nBoth 2-in-1 laptops are ultimately great for traveling, but don't make a final decision before I discuss the display and, especially, the performance.\n\nSurface Pro 12-inch vs. Surface Go 4: Display\n\nA look at the Surface Pro 12-inch with keyboard attached. (Image credit: Future | Daniel Rubino)\n\nThe Surface Go 4's display measures 10.5 inches with a 3:2 aspect ratio and a 1920x1280 resolution. That works out to 220 pixels per inch (PPI).\n\nThe Surface Pro has a larger 12-inch display with a 3:2 aspect ratio, but its 2196x1464 resolution works out to the same 220 PPI.\n\nThat goes to show how good the Go 4's display still is today. Microsoft lists a 1500:1 contrast ratio on the Go 4, besting the Pro 12-inch's 1200:1 ratio.\n\nHowever, the Pro 12-inch pulls ahead of the Go 4's 60Hz refresh rate, boosting it to 90Hz for a smoother view that's easier on the eyes. The Pro 12-inch should also get brighter.\n\nBoth devices have 10-point touch displays with pen compatibility, but the Pro 12-inch is the right choice if you want the best inking experience with haptic feedback.\n\nThe Go 4's display has relatively thick bezels, and its smaller size will impact some workflows. The Pro 12-inch has thinner bezels for a more modern look, and the larger screen will benefit many users.\n\nSurface Pro 12-inch vs. Surface Go 4: Performance and battery\n\nDisplay bezels are much thicker on the Surface Go. (Image credit: Future)\n\nThe Surface Go 4 is equipped with a 4-core Intel N200 CPU with a 1GHz clock. Even in 2023, when the Go 4 launched, this chip wasn't very impressive.\n\nRealistically, it has enough power for very light computing; multitasking will pull it to a standstill in most cases.\n\nOn the other hand, the Surface Pro 12-inch has an 8-core Qualcomm Snapdragon X Plus (X1P-42) SoC with a 3.2GHz multi-core frequency, integrated GPU with 1.7 TFLOPs of power, and a Neural Processing Unit (NPU) for full access to Copilot+ tools.\n\nEditor-in-Chief Daniel Rubino went hands-on with the Surface Pro 12-inch and did some preliminary benchmarking. Looking at Geekbench 6 scores puts the performance difference into perspective.\n\nSwipe to scroll horizontally Header Cell - Column 0 Geekbench 6 (Single-core) Geekbench 6 (Multi-core) Intel N200 790 2,132 Snapdragon X Plus (X1P-42) 2,422 11,080\n\nGeekbench, of course, doesn't provide a full picture of real-world performance. But a 3x increase on single-core and a 5x increase on multi-core power is no joke.\n\nIf you want a PC that can do more than just email and light web browsing, the Surface Pro 12-inch is the easy choice.\n\nThat's before getting into Copilot+ AI tools available for the Pro 12-inch. Because its NPU hits 45 TOPS of power for local AI work, it'll handle Copilot+ features (like Recall, Click to Do, Cocreator, etc.) just as well as the Surface Pro 11.\n\n👉 Related: Surface Pro 12-inch vs. Surface Pro 11\n\nThe Surface Go 4's RAM and storage options also aren't as impressive. It's locked into 8GB of LPDDR5 RAM (more wouldn't make much of a difference to the N200 CPU), and it tops out at 256GB of storage.\n\nThe Surface Pro 12-inch has 16GB of LPDDR5x RAM as standard, and it's available with 256GB or 512GB of storage.\n\nBoth PCs use UFS instead of real SSDs. They're more efficient but generally slower. The Surface Pro 12-inch's storage can technically be upgraded after purchase if you don't mind opening the case, while the Go 4 only offers microSD expansion.\n\nAs for battery life, I won't make any concrete claims until we've had more time with the Surface Pro 12-inch. The Go 4, however, generally runs for about five or six hours if you're pushing it.\n\nWith Qualcomm's efficiency, I expect to see the Pro 12-inch offer better battery life.\n\nThe Pro 12 runs Windows 11 on Snapdragon due to its chip's ARM64 architecture, whereas the Go 4 runs standard Windows 11.\n\nThe major difference between the two OS versions boils down to app compatibility. Windows on ARM64 is better than ever these days, and I wouldn't let some occasional emulation requirements stand in your way of picking up the Pro 12-inch.\n\nYou can check app and game compatibility at the WorksOnWoA website, and I urge you to check out the best native Windows on Snapdragon apps.\n\nSurface Pro 12-inch vs. Surface Go 4: Which should you buy?\n\nI kind of felt like I was beating up on the Surface Go 4 in this comparison, but that's only testament to how much better the new Surface Pro 12-inch really is.\n\nThe Snapdragon X Plus chip inside is somewhere around five times as powerful as the Intel N200 in the Go 4, and considering how small a price difference there is between the two PCs, that should be enough to help you make a final decision.\n\nEverything about the Surface Pro 12-inch feels more refined, from the slimmer display bezels to the thinner chassis to the new keyboard.\n\nUnless you find an incredible deal on a Surface Go 4, the regular price difference is just too small, and it's far easier to recommend the Surface Pro 12-inch.\n\nNew 12\" 2-in-1 Surface Pro 12-inch Check Amazon View at Best Buy The new Surface Pro 12-inch easily bests the Go 4 when it comes to performance and design. Considering the close price difference between the two devices, I can easily recommend the new Pro 12-inch over the Go 4 for the vast majority of users."
